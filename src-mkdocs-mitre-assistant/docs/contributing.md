Contributions from anyone are welcomed, and not limited to code.  I am very interested in help with end-user education, or solving problems that kill productivity.  If you find yourself in such situations, you can contribute your constraint via GitHub, and I will help as much as I can.

All contributions submitted will be credited to the submitter of issue/suggestion.
