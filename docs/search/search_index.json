The Mitre-Assistant surfaced as a collaboration tool amongst many people and skillsets that needed to work with The Mitre Corporation's ATT&CK Matrix. We needed to expedite both tactical and strategic business plans between security experts and business leaders to support both customers and security community forums. We realized the ecosystem of utilities in the public domain were incomplete, or not capable of offering us the flexibility we were looking for in the pursuit of our security and business objectives. The main purpose of this utility is to reduce friction between business professionals and the ATT&CK Matrix. I hope you find this contribution useful in your own business setting. What does it do? The Mitre-Assistant at its core is a command-line utility intended to be used for data pipeline workflows to power several applications. It parses the Mitre STIX CTI Repository into a more intuitive and friendlier JSON format, and present insightful information to users of the ATT&CK Matrix. The tool offers a flexible set of features to allow for the quick extraction of desired information from the ATT&CK Matrix. ProTip: Experiment | Get Techniques By Specific Datasource & Tactic Try to obtain all of the techniques that can be detected with the api-monitoring datasource. When you get there, and don'ty find an easy way to do this yourself immediately, now you can use the mitre assistant like this: mitre-assistant search -m enterprise -t \"api-monitoring\" And filter with our favorite tools by the ones on the Lateral Movement tactic mitre-assistant search -m enterprise -t \"api-monitoring\" | grep -i \"lateral-movement\" For a complete listing of the features or capabilities offered in Mitre-Assistant, please refer to the Features Section How does it help? For Both Strategic and Tactical Planning If you are practitioner in charge of managing a technical security program, you will need to model and design detection coverage programs based on the ATT&CK Matrix. This utility will save tons of time, I guarantee it. You will be able to slice & dice the matrix by different views or criteria you are interested in so you can rapidly share information with your team and external partners. You are also able to export your queries to JSON and CSV . For Threat Modeling If you are in a particular industry, for example in Finance, and you need to quickly know all of the FIN adversaries according to the ATT&CK Matrix, what do they do, which malware do they use, and what techniques are attributed to these for your own emulation plans, then please don't waste time, look at this below. mitre-assistant search -m enterprise -t \"fin4,fin5,fin6,fin7,fin8,fin10\" This query above will bring you all of the existing information for all of those adversaries, and produce a table like this below. Query Output Snippet Where can I get it? The utility can be obtained from the releases section of the Github repo where it is being actively developed, or if you are a rustlang user, you can just install via the cargo package manager.

You can use pre-built binaries for your operating system. Go Here: releases section 2. You can install from crates.io. Go Here: crates.io mitre-assistant 3. You can build from source. Follow the instructions below for Building From Source Building From Source You will need to have installed the rust stable toolchain, then clone the github repository, then build, like this: Mitre-Assistant Building From Source Clone Repo git clone https://github.com/dfirence/mitre-assistant.git Build Repo cd mitre-assistant Then Build cargo build --release Copy Your Binary cp -v ./target/release/mitre-assistant ~/.cargo/bin Or if you want to move it to a global env for all users sudo cp -v ./target/release/mitre-assistant /usr/bin/mitre-assistant What is a Mitre-Assistant Baseline? It is a custom JSON file I created for the Mitre-Assistant to use in its representation of data you will query for. Think of it as the backend database used by the program. Setup Baselines The Mitre-Assistant is buildt with an ETL concept. The ETL stands for, extract , transform , load . The primary datasource is provided by The Mitre Corporation's STIX CTI Repo , and from here, you will be able to access each specific matrix type. The Mitre-Assistant leverages at this time, the enterprise matrix , which is provided by the json file in the matrix. Finally the Mitre-Assistant allows you to download that file, and upon downloading, it begins to extract/transform/load the data in a custom JSON format I created so it is easier to work with the original STIX Format. Follow these steps to set up your baselines. Step 1 - Get The Enterprise Matrix mitre-assistant download -m enterprise Step 2 - Create The Baseline mitre-assistant baseline -m enterprise Step 3 - Validate The Baseline ls -la ~/.mitre-assistant/baselines Setup a Legacy Baseline The legacy baseline, is the previous version of the Mitre ATT&CK Matrix - V6. This is the version that did not have subtechniques being introduced into the matrix. You can work with that legacy mode by using the commandline options below. Step 1 - Get The Legacy Enterprise Matrix Notice the usage of enterprise-legacy in these steps :) mitre-assistant download -m enterprise-legacy Step 2 - Create The Baseline mitre-assistant baseline -m enterprise-legacy Step 3 - Validate The Baseline ls -la ~/.mitre-assistant/baselines Updating Baselines As you download the baselines into your machine, you are essentially working with a snapshot of the CTI Repo for the day you downloaded it. If, you want to continuously update the local baselines, you must do this yourself. An easy way to achieve this, is by setting up a Windows Task or Linux Cron Job that runs the commands above for you on a continuous basis. Validating The Install To ensure everything is working after the steps above, you can now conduct a query, test the export to csv, or export to json, like this.
